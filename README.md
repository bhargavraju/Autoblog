Autoblog
========

This is a very simple tool which replicates articles from another blog. If the source article is removed, or even the whole source website disappears, the articles will remain readable on the autoblog. The whole idea is to setup as many autoblogs as possible, so that, when an article is published, it is replicated all over the place, making much more difficult to censor it.
